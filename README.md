# JavaScript Quiz

## Description

This web application is a short, timed quiz to test vanilla JavaScript knowledge! This project further grew my ability to solve problems utilizing web resources when coding. I also expanded my understanding of JavaScript functions and traversing the DOM. Event listeners also played a larger role in this project than my previous ones which was a bit of a struggle. However after much trial and error I can more firmly claim an understanding of event listeners and their utility. This project was especially challenging but provided vital practice for understanding the complex functionality of JavaScript.

## Installation

To run the code, clone the project directories from [my repository](https://github.com/sillytsundere/javascript-quiz) and open the index.html and script.js files in preferred code editor. The HTML file can be viewed to examine the basic display elements and how they are organized on the webpage. The Javascript file can be viewed to inspect the complex interactivity of the webpage. 

## Usage

The webpage is straightforward and easy to use; it begins with a header, containing the title, instructions for taking the quiz and a button to view high scores. Below the header is a "Start Quiz" button that disappears once clicked and shows the quiz itself. The quiz contains a set of seven questions about vanilla JavaScript. Each question has four answer choices. After each answer is picked the user clicks the "Next Question" button to move to the next question. If a question is answered correctly a point is added to the user's score. If a question is answered incorrectly time is deducted from the quiz timer.

Once the quiz is finished - either by running out of time or by answering all the questions - the user can save their score by typing their initials in the form and clicking the "Submit" button. Clicking the final "Submit" button will display the user's score and initials in a list with other saved scores pulled from local storage. From this page the user can click a "Back to Start" button which returns them to the initial page with the "Start Quiz" button.
